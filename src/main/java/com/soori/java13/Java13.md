Here is a brief overview of Java 13 features:

### Java 13 Features

1. **Text Blocks (Preview)**
   - Simplifies the creation of multi-line string literals.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String textBlock = """
         This is a text block.
         It spans multiple lines.
         """;
     ```

2. **Switch Expressions (Preview)**
   - Enhances the switch statement to be used as an expression.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int result = switch (day) {
         case "MONDAY", "FRIDAY", "SUNDAY" -> 6;
         case "TUESDAY" -> 7;
         case "THURSDAY", "SATURDAY" -> 8;
         case "WEDNESDAY" -> 9;
         default -> throw new IllegalStateException("Unexpected value: " + day);
     };
     ```

3. **Reimplement the Legacy Socket API**
   - Improves the implementation of the legacy socket API to be more maintainable and performant.

4. **Dynamic CDS Archives**
   - Enhances the application class-data sharing (CDS) to allow the dynamic archiving of classes at the end of application execution.

5. **ZGC: Uncommit Unused Memory**
   - Enhances the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) to return unused heap memory to the operating system.

### Enabling Preview Features
To use preview features like Text Blocks and Switch Expressions, compile and run your code with the `--enable-preview` flag:
```sh
javac --enable-preview --release 13 YourClass.java
java --enable-preview YourClass
```
