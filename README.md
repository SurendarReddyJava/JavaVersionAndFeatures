**Java Version And Features from java 8**


Java 8 introduced several significant features that revolutionized the way Java programming is done. Here are some of the key features:

1. **Lambda Expressions**: These provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. They enable functional programming and simplify the development of APIs and libraries.

2. **Method References**: These are a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. They make the code more readable and concise.

3. **Functional Interfaces**: An interface with a single abstract method, known as a SAM (Single Abstract Method) interface. Examples include `Runnable`, `Callable`, and the new interfaces in `java.util.function`.

4. **Stream API**: This allows for functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as map-reduce transformations on collections. It provides a way to perform bulk operations on collections in a declarative manner.

5. **Default Methods**: These allow the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing implementations. They provide a way to evolve interfaces.

6. **Optional Class**: This is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps in avoiding `NullPointerException` and provides methods to deal with the absence of a value.

7. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**: This allows Java applications to execute JavaScript code dynamically at runtime.

8. **New Date and Time API**: The `java.time` package provides a comprehensive model for date and time, improving upon the old `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.

9. **Base64 Encoding and Decoding**: Java 8 includes a utility class for Base64 encoding and decoding.

10. **Parallel Array Sorting**: The `Arrays.parallelSort` method uses the Fork/Join framework to sort large arrays more efficiently.

11. **Type Annotations**: These provide the ability to apply annotations to any use of a type, enhancing the way annotations are used in Java.

12. **Repeating Annotations**: This allows the same annotation to be applied multiple times to the same declaration or type use.

13. **Concurrency Enhancements**: New classes and methods in the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `CompletableFuture`, which simplifies asynchronous programming.

14. **Collectors Class**: This provides various methods to collect stream elements into collections, summarizing statistics, concatenating strings, etc.

15. **forEach() Method**: This method is used to iterate over elements of a collection and perform an action for each element.
