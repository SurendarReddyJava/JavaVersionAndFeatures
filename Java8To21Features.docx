Java 8: A Deep Dive into Key Features
Java 8 marked a significant milestone in the evolution of the Java programming language, introducing several powerful features designed to enhance code readability, efficiency, and expressiveness. Let’s explore these key features in detail:
1. Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions. They’re particularly useful for implementing functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method).
Syntax:
(parameters) -> expression // For single-expression lambdas
(parameters) -> { statements; } // For multi-statement lambdas
Example:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Ramesh", "Suresh", "Kamlesh", "Priya");

        names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name)); 
    }
}
This example uses a lambda expression name -> System.out.println(name) to iterate and print each name in the list.
2. Functional Interfaces
A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. The @FunctionalInterface annotation (optional but recommended) marks an interface as a functional interface. Lambda expressions are used to implement these interfaces.
Example:
@FunctionalInterface
interface GreetingService {
    void sayMessage(String message);
}

public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GreetingService greet = message -> System.out.println("Hello, " + message);
        greet.sayMessage("Ramesh");
    }
}
GreetingService is a functional interface. The lambda expression message -> System.out.println("Hello, " + message) provides the implementation for sayMessage.
3. Streams API
The Streams API introduces a new way to process collections of data in a declarative and functional style. It supports operations like filtering, mapping, sorting, and reducing.
Example:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class StreamsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

        List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                           .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                           .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println("Even Numbers: " + evenNumbers);
    }
}
This code creates a stream from a list of numbers, filters for even numbers, and collects the results into a new list.
4. Optional Class
The Optional class helps to handle situations where a value might be absent. It avoids NullPointerExceptions by explicitly representing the possibility of a missing value.
Example:
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> optionalName = Optional.of("Ramesh");

        if (optionalName.isPresent()) {
            System.out.println("Name: " + optionalName.get());
        }

        optionalName.ifPresent(name -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name));
    }
}
Optional.of("Ramesh") creates an Optional containing a value. isPresent() checks for the presence of a value, and ifPresent() executes a lambda expression if a value is present.
5. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
Java 8 allows adding default and static methods to interfaces. Default methods provide default implementations, avoiding breaking changes when adding new methods to existing interfaces. Static methods belong to the interface itself, not to its implementations.
Example:
interface Vehicle {
    default void print() {
        System.out.println("I am a vehicle");
    }

    static void blowHorn() {
        System.out.println("Blowing horn");
    }
}

public class DefaultMethodExample implements Vehicle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DefaultMethodExample car = new DefaultMethodExample();
        car.print();
        Vehicle.blowHorn();
    }
}
6. New Date and Time API (java.time)
The java.time package provides a comprehensive and improved date and time API, replacing the older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.
Example:
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class DateTimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        LocalDate specificDate = LocalDate.of(2023, 8, 10);

        System.out.println("Current Date: " + date);
        System.out.println("Current Time: " + time);
        System.out.println("Current Date and Time: " + dateTime);
        System.out.println("Specific Date: " + specificDate);
    }
}
7. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
Nashorn allowed execution of JavaScript code directly within Java applications. (Note: Nashorn is deprecated in later Java versions.)
8. Parallel Array Sorting
Arrays.parallelSort() provides a parallel sorting algorithm for arrays, potentially improving performance for large datasets.
9. Type Annotations
Type annotations allow annotations to be applied to types, providing more fine-grained control over metadata associated with types.
10. Method References
Method references offer a concise syntax for referring to existing methods, often simplifying lambda expressions.
Example:
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class MethodReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Ramesh", "Suresh", "Kamlesh");
        names.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
System.out::println is a method reference, directly calling the println method.
11. Collectors
Collectors are used with the Streams API to perform terminal operations, accumulating results into various data structures (like lists, maps, etc.).
12. New Files API (NIO.2)
The Java 8 release significantly enhanced the java.nio.file package, introducing the NIO.2 API. This API provides a more robust and feature-rich approach to file system interactions compared to older methods. It offers improved capabilities for handling files, directories, and overall file system access. Key improvements include streamlined directory stream handling, efficient file reading and writing, and more comprehensive file system access control.
Key Features of NIO.2
•	Path API: The Path interface represents a file or directory path in an abstract way, making code more portable across different operating systems.
•	Files Class: This class offers static methods for various file operations, like creating, deleting, copying, moving, and reading files.
•	Directory Stream: Provides an efficient way to iterate through directories and their contents.
•	Watch Service: Allows monitoring of file system changes (creation, modification, deletion) in a non-blocking manner.
•	File Attributes: Access to various file attributes (size, last modified time, permissions, etc.).
Example: Reading and Writing Files with NIO.2
This example demonstrates basic file reading and writing using the Files class:
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.List;

public class FilesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "example.txt";

        try {
            // Writing to a file
            Files.write(Paths.get(filePath), "Hello, Ramesh!".getBytes());

            // Reading from a file
            List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filePath));
            lines.forEach(System.out::println);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
1.	Files.write(Paths.get(filePath), "Hello, Ramesh!".getBytes()): This line writes the string “Hello, Ramesh!” to the file specified by filePath. Paths.get(filePath) creates a Path object, and .getBytes() converts the string into a byte array suitable for writing.
2.	Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filePath)): This line reads all lines from the file into a List<String>.
3.	lines.forEach(System.out::println): This iterates through the list of lines and prints each line to the console.
4.	try-catch block: Handles potential IOExceptions that might occur during file operations.
This example showcases the simplicity and efficiency of the NIO.2 API for common file operations. More advanced features, such as directory traversal and file system monitoring, can be explored using other classes and methods within the java.nio.file package.
Java 9: Key Features and Enhancements
Java 9, released in 2017, introduced a significant number of features aimed at improving performance, developer productivity, and overall application development. This guide explores the key enhancements.
1. Private Methods in Interfaces
Java 9 allows interfaces to contain private methods. This facilitates code reuse among default methods within the same interface, promoting better organization and reducing redundancy.
Example:
interface MyInterface {
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default Method");
        privateMethod();
    }

    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("Private Method");
    }
}

public class PrivateMethodsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface myInterface = new MyInterface() {};
        myInterface.defaultMethod();
    }
}
Output:
Default Method
Private Method
The privateMethod() is called by the defaultMethod(), demonstrating code sharing within the interface.
2. Immutable Collections
Java 9 introduced static factory methods (List.of(), Set.of(), Map.of()) for creating immutable collections. These methods provide a convenient way to create collections whose contents cannot be modified after creation, enhancing thread safety and predictability.
Example:
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.Map;

public class ImmutableCollectionsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> immutableList = List.of("A", "B", "C");
        Set<String> immutableSet = Set.of("X", "Y", "Z");
        Map<String, Integer> immutableMap = Map.of("One", 1, "Two", 2);

        System.out.println("Immutable List: " + immutableList);
        System.out.println("Immutable Set: " + immutableSet);
        System.out.println("Immutable Map: " + immutableMap);
    }
}
Output:
Immutable List: [A, B, C]
Immutable Set: [X, Y, Z]
Immutable Map: {One=1, Two=2}
3. Stream API Improvements
The Stream API received several enhancements, including the addition of takeWhile(), dropWhile(), and improvements to iterate(). These methods provide more flexible and concise ways to process streams.
Example:
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class StreamImprovementsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);

        List<Integer> taken = numbers.stream().takeWhile(n -> n < 5).collect(Collectors.toList());
        List<Integer> dropped = numbers.stream().dropWhile(n -> n < 5).collect(Collectors.toList());
        Stream<Integer> iterated = Stream.iterate(0, n -> n < 10, n -> n + 2);

        System.out.println("takeWhile: " + taken);
        System.out.println("dropWhile: " + dropped);
        iterated.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
Output:
takeWhile: [1, 2, 3, 4]
dropWhile: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
0
2
4
6
8
4. Optional Class Improvements
The Optional class gained new methods like ifPresentOrElse(), or(), and stream(), offering more expressive ways to handle potentially missing values.
Example:
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalImprovementsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> optionalValue = Optional.of("Java 9");

        optionalValue.ifPresentOrElse(value -> System.out.println("Value: " + value), () -> System.out.println("Value not present"));
        Optional<String> alternative = optionalValue.or(() -> Optional.of("Alternative"));
        optionalValue.stream().forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("Alternative: " + alternative.get());
    }
}
Output:
Value: Java 9
Java 9
Alternative: Java 9
5. JShell: The Interactive Java Shell
JShell is an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for Java. It allows developers to execute Java code snippets quickly without needing a full compilation and execution cycle. This is invaluable for testing, experimenting, and learning.
6. Module System (Project Jigsaw)
The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), also known as Project Jigsaw, is a major architectural change. It allows developers to create modular applications, improving encapsulation, maintainability, and reducing dependencies. (Explaining modules in detail would require a separate, extensive document.)
7. HTTP/2 Client
Java 9 introduced a new, more efficient HTTP client supporting HTTP/2, WebSockets, and asynchronous operations.
8. Process API Improvements
The Process API received enhancements, offering more control over native processes, including improved management of process trees and access to process information.
9. Miscellaneous Changes
Java 9 included many other smaller but significant changes: Multi-Release JARs, unified JVM logging, enhanced @Deprecated annotation, and compact strings (using byte arrays for strings).
10. Summary
Java 9 significantly advanced the Java platform with features designed to improve both developer experience and application performance. The module system, in particular, represents a fundamental shift in how Java applications are structured and managed. The other enhancements, such as improvements to Streams, Optional, and the HTTP client, contribute to a more modern and efficient development environment.
Java 10: Key Features and Enhancements
Java 10, released in March 2018, brought several significant improvements focusing on developer productivity and application performance. This guide details the key features.
1. Local-Variable Type Inference (var)
Java 10 introduced the var keyword, enabling local variable type inference. The compiler infers the type based on the initializer, leading to more concise and readable code.
Example:
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class VarExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var list = new ArrayList<String>();
        list.add("Java 10");
        list.add("Local-Variable Type Inference");

        var map = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
        map.put("Java", 10);

        for (var item : list) {
            System.out.println(item);
        }

        for (var entry : map.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
Output:
Java 10
Local-Variable Type Inference
Java: 10
Note that var is only applicable to local variables with initializers; it cannot be used for method parameters or class fields.
2. Enhanced Immutable Collections
Java 10 extended the capabilities for creating immutable collections.
2.1 List.copyOf(), Set.copyOf(), Map.copyOf()
These methods create unmodifiable copies of existing collections.
Example:
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.Map;

public class ImmutableCollectionsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> originalList = List.of("A", "B", "C");
        List<String> immutableList = List.copyOf(originalList);

        Set<String> originalSet = Set.of("X", "Y", "Z");
        Set<String> immutableSet = Set.copyOf(originalSet);

        Map<String, Integer> originalMap = Map.of("One", 1, "Two", 2);
        Map<String, Integer> immutableMap = Map.copyOf(originalMap);

        System.out.println("Immutable List: " + immutableList);
        System.out.println("Immutable Set: " + immutableSet);
        System.out.println("Immutable Map: " + immutableMap);
    }
}
Output:
Immutable List: [A, B, C]
Immutable Set: [X, Y, Z]
Immutable Map: {One=1, Two=2}
2.2 Collectors.toUnmodifiableList(), toUnmodifiableSet(), toUnmodifiableMap()
These collectors create unmodifiable collections from streams.
Example:
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class UnmodifiableCollectorsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = Stream.of("Java", "10", "Features").collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableList());
        Set<String> set = Stream.of("A", "B", "C").collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableSet());
        Map<String, Integer> map = Stream.of("One", "Two")
                .collect(Collectors.toUnmodifiableMap(s -> s, s -> s.length()));

        System.out.println("Unmodifiable List: " + list);
        System.out.println("Unmodifiable Set: " + set);
        System.out.println("Unmodifiable Map: " + map);
    }
}
Output:
Unmodifiable List: [Java, 10, Features]
Unmodifiable Set: [A, B, C]
Unmodifiable Map: {One=3, Two=3}
3. Optional.orElseThrow()
This new method in the Optional class returns the contained value if present, otherwise it throws a NoSuchElementException. It provides a more concise way to handle potentially missing values compared to previous approaches.
4. Time-Based Release Versioning
Java 10 shifted to a time-based release model, with feature releases every six months and Long-Term Support (LTS) releases every three years. This provides more predictable release cycles.
5. Parallel Full GC for G1
Java 10 improved the G1 garbage collector by enabling parallel processing during full garbage collections, leading to reduced pause times and better performance, especially for applications with large heaps.
6. Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS)
AppCDS extends the existing Class-Data Sharing (CDS) to include application classes, further reducing startup time and memory footprint by sharing data across multiple JVM instances. (Detailed steps for using AppCDS are beyond the scope of this concise summary).
7. Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler (Graal)
Graal, an experimental Java-based JIT compiler, was introduced. (Enabling Graal requires specific JVM flags).
8. Other Changes in Java 10
Several other improvements were included, such as support for heap allocation on alternative memory devices, additional Unicode language-tag extensions, a new garbage collector interface, a default set of root certificates, thread-local handshakes, and removal of the javah tool.
9. Conclusion
Java 10 delivered notable enhancements, improving developer productivity and application performance. Features like var, immutable collection improvements, and AppCDS are particularly impactful for modern Java development.
Java 11: Key Features and Enhancements
Java 11, released in September 2018 as a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, brought many significant features and improvements to the Java platform. This guide explores the key additions.
1. Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters
Java 11 extends the var keyword to lambda expressions, enabling local variable type inference for lambda parameters. This improves consistency and flexibility.
Example:
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class VarInLambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = List.of("Java", "11", "Features");

        Consumer<String> consumer = (var item) -> System.out.println(item);
        list.forEach(consumer);
    }
}
Output:
Java
11
Features
The var keyword infers the type of the item parameter within the lambda expression.
2. Standardized HTTP Client
The HTTP Client, initially previewed in Java 9, became a standard feature in Java 11. This modern API supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, providing a robust and feature-rich mechanism for making HTTP requests.
Example: HTTP GET Request
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

public class HttpClientExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                                         .uri(new URI("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"))
                                         .GET()
                                         .build();

        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
        System.out.println("Response: " + response.body());
    }
}
Output: (will vary slightly depending on the API response)
Response: {
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
  "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit..."
}
3. New Collection.toArray() Method
A new toArray(IntFunction<T[]>) method was added to the Collection interface. This improves type safety and performance when converting collections to arrays.
Example:
import java.util.List;

public class CollectionToArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = List.of("Java", "11", "Features");
        String[] array = list.toArray(String[]::new);

        for (String item : array) {
            System.out.println(item);
        }
    }
}
Output:
Java
11
Features
4. New String Methods
Several helpful methods were added to the String class:
•	isBlank(): Checks if a string is empty or contains only whitespace.
•	lines(): Returns a stream of lines from the string.
•	strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing(): Remove leading/trailing/all whitespace.
•	repeat(): Repeats a string a specified number of times. (Examples for each of these are provided in the original text).
5. Files.readString() and writeString()
These new methods in the Files class simplify file I/O by directly reading and writing strings to files. (Example provided in the original text).
6. Path.of()
Path.of() provides a more concise and readable way to create Path instances compared to the older Paths.get(). (Example and comparison provided in the original text).
7. Epsilon: A No-Op Garbage Collector
Epsilon is a garbage collector that performs no memory reclamation. It’s useful for specialized scenarios like performance testing and short-lived applications where garbage collection overhead is undesirable. (Enabling Epsilon requires specific JVM flags).
8. Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs
Java 11 allows the direct execution of single Java source files without explicit compilation. This simplifies testing and quick code experiments. (Example provided in the original text).
9. Nest-Based Access Control
This feature enhances encapsulation by allowing classes within a “nest” (logically grouped classes) to access each other’s private members. (Example provided in the original text).
10. Enhanced Analysis Tools
Java 11 improved tools for analyzing application performance:
•	Java Flight Recorder (JFR): A powerful profiling tool for recording detailed runtime information. (Enabling JFR requires JVM flags).
•	Low-Overhead Heap Profiling: Provides heap usage details with minimal performance impact. (Enabling this requires JVM flags).
11. Experimental and Preview Features
Java 11 included experimental features like ZGC (Z Garbage Collector), a scalable, low-latency garbage collector designed for large heaps. (Enabling ZGC requires JVM flags).
12. Deprecations and Removals
Several features were deprecated or removed in Java 11, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the platform. Key examples include the removal of Java EE and CORBA modules, and the deprecation of the Nashorn JavaScript engine and Pack200 tools.
13. Other Changes
Other enhancements in Java 11 include: support for Unicode 10; improvements to Aarch64 intrinsics; support for TLS 1.3; addition of ChaCha20 and Poly1305 cryptographic algorithms; support for key agreement with Curve25519 and Curve448; and dynamic class-file constants.
Conclusion
Java 11, as an LTS release, provided substantial improvements to the Java platform. Features like the standardized HTTP client, improved string methods, and enhanced analysis tools significantly benefit developers and application performance.
Java 12: Key Features and Enhancements
Java 12, released in March 2019 (a non-LTS release), brought several notable improvements to developer productivity and application performance. This guide details the key features.
1. New String and Files Methods
Java 12 enhanced the String and Files classes with new methods.
1.1 String.indent()
This method adjusts the indentation of each line in a string, adding or removing spaces from the beginning of each line.
Example:
public class StringIndentExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Java\nFeatures\nIndentation";

        String indentedText = text.indent(4);
        String reducedIndentationText = indentedText.indent(-2);

        System.out.println("Original Text:\n" + text);
        System.out.println("Indented Text:\n" + indentedText);
        System.out.println("Reduced Indentation Text:\n" + reducedIndentationText);
    }
}
Output:
Original Text:
Java
Features
Indentation
Indented Text:
    Java
    Features
    Indentation
Reduced Indentation Text:
  Java
  Features
  Indentation
1.2 String.transform()
This method applies a function to a string and returns the result, enabling chained transformations.
Example:
import java.util.Locale;

public class StringTransformExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "java features";
        String transformedText = text.transform(s -> s.toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT) + " - Java 12");

        System.out.println("Original Text: " + text);
        System.out.println("Transformed Text: " + transformedText);
    }
}
Output:
Original Text: java features

    }
}
The switch statement directly handles different types (Integer, String, Double), improving code clarity.
2.2 Record Patterns (Preview) – JEP 405
Record patterns extend pattern matching to allow deconstructing records within patterns, simplifying work with data classes.
Example:
record Point(int x, int y) {}

public class RecordPatternsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point point = new Point(10, 20);

        // Using record pattern to deconstruct a record
        if (point instanceof Point(int x, int y)) {
            System.out.println("Point coordinates: (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
        }
    }
}
if (point instanceof Point(int x, int y)) deconstructs the Point record into its x and y components.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a vector species of type int with size 256
        VectorSpecies<Integer> SPECIES = IntVector.SPECIES_256;

        // Initialize two int arrays
        int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
        int[] b = {8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};

        // Perform vector addition
        IntVector va = IntVector.fromArray(SPECIES, a, 0);
        IntVector vb = IntVector.fromArray(SPECIES, b, 0);
        IntVector vc = va.add(vb);

        // Store the result in an array
        int[] c = new int[8];
        vc.intoArray(c, 0);

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Vector addition result: " + Arrays.toString(c));
    }
}
The Vector API facilitates vectorized computations for efficient execution on compatible hardware.
3. Deprecations and Deletions
