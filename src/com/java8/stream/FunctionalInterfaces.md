Java 8 introduced several functional interfaces to support lambda expressions and functional programming. Here are some of the key functional interfaces added:

1. BiConsumer<T, U>: Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
2. **BiFunction<T, U, R>**: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
3. **BinaryOperator<T>**: Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
4. **BiPredicate<T, U>**: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of two arguments.
5. **BooleanSupplier**: Represents a supplier of boolean-valued results.
6. **Consumer<T>**: Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
7. **DoubleBinaryOperator**: Represents an operation upon two double-valued operands and produces a double-valued result.
8. **DoubleConsumer**: Represents an operation that accepts a single double-valued argument and returns no result.
9. **DoubleFunction<R>**: Represents a function that accepts a double-valued argument and produces a result.
10. **DoublePredicate**: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one double-valued argument.
11. **DoubleSupplier**: Represents a supplier of double-valued results.
12. **DoubleToIntFunction**: Represents a function that accepts a double-valued argument and produces an int-valued result.
13. **DoubleToLongFunction**: Represents a function that accepts a double-valued argument and produces a long-valued result.
14. **DoubleUnaryOperator**: Represents an operation on a single double-valued operand that produces a double-valued result.
15. **Function<T, R>**: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
16. **IntBinaryOperator**: Represents an operation upon two int-valued operands and produces an int-valued result.
17. **IntConsumer**: Represents an operation that accepts a single int-valued argument and returns no result.
18. **IntFunction<R>**: Represents a function that accepts an int-valued argument and produces a result.
19. **IntPredicate**: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one int-valued argument.
20. **IntSupplier**: Represents a supplier of int-valued results.
21. **IntToDoubleFunction**: Represents a function that accepts an int-valued argument and produces a double-valued result.
22. **IntToLongFunction**: Represents a function that accepts an int-valued argument and produces a long-valued result.
23. **IntUnaryOperator**: Represents an operation on a single int-valued operand that produces an int-valued result.
24. **LongBinaryOperator**: Represents an operation upon two long-valued operands and produces a long-valued result.
25. **LongConsumer**: Represents an operation that accepts a single long-valued argument and returns no result.
26. **LongFunction<R>**: Represents a function that accepts a long-valued argument and produces a result.
27. **LongPredicate**: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one long-valued argument.
28. **LongSupplier**: Represents a supplier of long-valued results.
29. **LongToDoubleFunction**: Represents a function that accepts a long-valued argument and produces a double-valued result.
30. **LongToIntFunction**: Represents a function that accepts a long-valued argument and produces an int-valued result.
31. **LongUnaryOperator**: Represents an operation on a single long-valued operand that produces a long-valued result.
32. **ObjDoubleConsumer<T>**: Represents an operation that accepts an object-valued and a double-valued argument, and returns no result.
33. **ObjIntConsumer<T>**: Represents an operation that accepts an object-valued and an int-valued argument, and returns no result.
34. **ObjLongConsumer<T>**: Represents an operation that accepts an object-valued and a long-valued argument, and returns no result.
35. **Predicate<T>**: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
36. **Supplier<T>**: Represents a supplier of results.
37. **ToDoubleBiFunction<T, U>**: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a double-valued result.
38. **ToDoubleFunction<T>**: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a double-valued result.
39. **ToIntBiFunction<T, U>**: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces an int-valued result.
40. **ToIntFunction<T>**: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces an int-valued result.
41. **ToLongBiFunction<T, U>**: Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a long-valued result.
42. **ToLongFunction<T>**: Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a long-valued result.
43. **UnaryOperator<T>**: Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand¹²³.

These interfaces are part of the `java.util.function` package and are widely used in lambda expressions and stream operations. If you need more details or examples on any specific interface, feel free to ask!
